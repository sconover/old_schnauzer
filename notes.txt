schnauzer compatability test
  - encourage people on other browser/os combos to write schnauzer-interface-equivalent implementations
  - good pressure here to keep schnauzer focused and simple
  - show that ajax works, js works, visual measures work
    - against a sample rails app
    - requests are local
    - the kinds of things that prove a real browser is there
    - plus perf numbers at the end

- opportunity to make webrat use it?
  - webrat's facilities are probably limited (no assumption of js env) (look into this)


Schnauzer.new do |request, response|
  #handle the request, write to the response
end

...request and response are rack-compliant


make all of this work: http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/files/SPEC.html
  ...adapt Objc url objects to rack.
